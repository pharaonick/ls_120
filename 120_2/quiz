1.
no attr
no increment of total cats
no custom to_s

2. ***************************************
init that sets @name to name
attr for grade / set directly to nil

in the last snippet, even though there's an attr for grade, it's not initialized...
calling `ade.grade` would return `nil` because it's an uninitialized ivar
NOT because it's been set to `nil` **********************

3.
`name` and `name=` getter and setter for name attribute
'grade' and 'grade=' getter and setter
not sure what the 22 is...

4. 
calling `name` on a Knight object adds 'Sir ' to @name but does not set it
 - either set @name
 - or call name method from speak

5. 
override the Character#speak method

6. *******************************
call super from Lamb.new.speak
subclass Cow from FarmAnimal
NOTE `self` vs `self.class` -- just `self` returns the object encapsulation rep

7. collaborator object is one that is assigned to an ivar in another object?

*******************************
8. ivar pointing to obj 
... could argue that "Sara" and "Fluffy" are custom objects referenced by ivar
so not sure...
EXCEPT
a string is a standard object that comes with the Ruby library

9.
Classes can't be used for namespacing...?

10.
supervise
speak to customer
